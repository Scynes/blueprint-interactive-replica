# Blueprint Interactive Clone

A pixel-perfect replica of the [Blueprint Interactive website](https://blueprintinteractive.com/index.html), built from scratch in 3 hours using pure vanilla HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

## Overview

This project is a hand-coded recreation of Blueprint Interactive's official website. While the original site appears to be built on WordPress, this version is built entirely with vanilla technologies—no frameworks, no libraries, just pure code. The goal here is to demonstrate the ability to design and build clean, responsive interfaces without relying on external dependencies, which would only speed things up further when those tools are available.

Features include:
- Responsive design with container queries
- Smooth scroll effects and glass morphism navigation
- Interactive video carousel with custom controls
- All animations and interactions built from scratch

## Quick Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

2. Start the dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

3. Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

The production build will be in the `dist` folder.
